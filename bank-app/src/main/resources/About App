This is a simple springboot program that models how a banking app would work. Users can log in, sign up;
check their balance, withdraw and deposit money; convert funds between 5 currencies change password and username

# Springboot is an enhanced version of spring as it comes preconfigured with dependencies such as Spring MVC
Spring Security, Spring Data, a Web Server etc. Thereby making it far easier to create/deploy a web application.
It is a more streamlined version of Spring and comes with a lot of built-in features

## IoC Container
Spring Boot allows you to configure how and when dependencies are provided to your application at runtime. This
puts you in control of how your application operates in different scenarios. Inversion of control is often called
Dependency Injection (DI) i.e. dependencies are "injected" into their applications at runtime.

## TDD
Test Driven Development is a tried-and-true technique to help application developers design simple yet robust
software, plus guard against functionality regressions and bugs.

## Apache Maven
It manages programs by bundling all the necessary dependencies

## Spring Boot Layers
- Persistence: handles interaction with database (repository pattern or DAO's)
- Service: all the functionality exposed by the persistence layer (calls must always go through here)
- Presentation: it should never connect directly to the database

The technique of separating the application into layers is called Separation of Concerns
Connect the database to the persistence layer using JPA (Java Persistence API) or MongoDB. Generate the classes
for the models, repositories, services and controllers with the help of lombok.
- create the models first
- then the repositories
- then the services
- then the controllers
